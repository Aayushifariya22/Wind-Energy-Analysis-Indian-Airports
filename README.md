# üå¨Ô∏è Wind Speed Analysis for Renewable Energy at Indian Airports

This project analyzes wind speed data from Indian airports to evaluate the feasibility of wind energy generation using statistical modeling techniques. With India aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, renewable energy integration at airports‚Äîespecially wind energy as a supplement to solar‚Äîis an emerging necessity. This project explores the viability of using Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) by modeling wind speed distributions and estimating potential energy output.

## ‚ùì Why This Project?

India‚Äôs aviation sector is expanding rapidly, increasing its energy demands. While solar panels are already installed at several airports, their efficiency drops drastically during monsoon months. This motivated us to explore **wind energy as a consistent and complementary source**. Airports located near coastlines or open plains have favorable wind conditions. Inspired by Mumbai Airport‚Äôs hybrid SolarMill system, we aimed to evaluate wind energy‚Äôs potential using a statistical approach.

## üìÇ From Where is the Data Taken?

- **Source**: METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from **Iowa State University**
- **Time Frame**: 2017‚Äì2023
- **Airports**: 11 airports including Porbandar, Rajkot, Tuticorin, Chennai, Kolkata, etc.
- **Frequency**: Wind speed observations recorded every 30 seconds
- **Key Variables Used**: `valid` (timestamp), `sknt` (wind speed), `lat`, `lon`

## üìò Project Description

We conducted a statistical analysis of wind speed data from 11 Indian airports. Based on average wind speed and skewness, three airports‚Äî**Porbandar**, **Rajkot**, and **Tuticorin**‚Äîwere shortlisted. Wind speed distributions were modeled using **Weibull** and **Truncated Weibull Distributions**, and energy output was estimated. Finally, feasibility of **Savonius VAWTs** for airport-scale deployment was evaluated.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Model wind speed using Weibull and Truncated Weibull distributions.
2. Estimate wind energy output using statistical distributions.
3. Evaluate the suitability of Savonius VAWTs at airports.
4. Suggest wind-based renewable energy as a supplement to solar.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

- Converted wind speed from knots to m/s
- Focused on monsoon months (June‚ÄìSeptember)
- Imputed missing values using **ARIMA modeling**
- Shortlisted airports with:
  - Mean wind speed > 3 m/s
  - Positive skewness in data

---

## üìä Methodology

### 1. ARIMA Modeling
- Used to impute missing values by modeling seasonal and trend components
- Auto ARIMA (`auto.arima()`) was used for time series forecasting

### 2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Used to estimate shape (`k`) and scale (`c`) parameters for:
  - **Weibull Distribution**
  - **Truncated Weibull Distribution** (range: 3‚Äì10 m/s)

### 3. Goodness-of-Fit Testing
- **Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov (KS) Test**
- **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**

‚úÖ *Truncated Weibull consistently provided better fits, especially for Porbandar.*

### 4. Mean Energy Density Estimation

**Used Formula:**

`P_D = 0.5 √ó œÅ √ó c¬≥ √ó Œì(1 + 3/k)`

Where:
- `œÅ` = Air density (1.225 kg/m¬≥)
- `c` = Scale parameter
- `k` = Shape parameter

This was extended to estimate power output using turbine area, efficiency, and time.
